# Typing-Animation

This is a simple HTML and CSS project that creates a webpage with a typing animation effect for displaying the text "REZA DYSTA SATRIA".

## Features

- **Typing Animation**: The text "REZA DYSTA SATRIA" is animated with a typing effect.
- **Responsive Design**: The font size adjusts based on the screen width, ensuring the text is always readable.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the HTML elements, including animations.

## Key CSS Animations

- **Typing Animation**: Uses `@keyframes` to create a typing effect by adjusting the `width` property of the text container.
- **Caret Blinking**: A blinking caret effect is achieved using another `@keyframes` animation that toggles the `border-color`.

## Media Queries

  - For screens up to 600px: font-size is 1.5em.
  - For screens between 601px and 1200px: font-size is 2.5em.
  - For screens above 1200px: font-size is 3.5em.
